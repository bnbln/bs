# Rebrand and digital transformation for a Berlin law firm

For the Berlin law firm Rechtsklarheit and lawyer Tarik Sharif, the relaunch wasn’t just about aesthetics - it was about building a fast, reliable, and editor-friendly digital foundation. The new brand identity set the tone, but the real strength lies in the **frontend stack: Gatsby, React, Netlify, and Netlify CMS**.

A rebranding and web development project where corporate gravitas meets the flexibility of a modern JAMstack approach.

## Why Gatsby & React?

**Gatsby** delivers blazing-fast static pages with strong SEO benefits, while **React** components allow for a modular system: legal content, services, and blog posts all follow the same design logic.  

Hosting on **Netlify** ensures global CDN delivery, continuous deployment from Git, and automated builds — meaning every change goes live within minutes.  

## Content Editing Made Simple

Behind the scenes, **Netlify CMS** empowers the firm’s team to manage their own content without touching code.  
- Blog posts, service pages, and updates can be added through a simple UI.  
- The CMS writes directly to the Git repository, keeping the workflow consistent and version-controlled.  
- Editors enjoy a clean, structured dashboard tailored to their needs.  
- Contact forms flow directly into the E-Mail inbox of the law firm.


## Performance & Scalability

- **Performance**: Lighthouse scores consistently above 90  
- **Scalability**: New practice areas or features can be added easily thanks to React components  
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance built into the design system  
- **Security**: HTTPS/SSL by default via Netlify  

The result is a site that looks professional, performs brilliantly, and is easy for the firm to maintain long term.  


## Confidence meets Clarity

The visual language is simple and strong: A deep blue establishes trust and reliability, while subtle turquoise accents add a modern twist. The logo feels calm and confident, designed for flexible use across all media. The typography is clean and structured, ensuring excellent readability – especially on mobile.

## Built for Daily Use

The design system is modular, allowing dynamic layouts for service pages, legal content, or blog posts. The site is built with Next.js, hosted via Vercel for top performance, and content can be edited easily via a lightweight CMS.

The result: A consistent, flexible system that looks professional and can grow with the firm's needs – whether it’s expanding legal topics, adding blog posts or publishing updates.

For the coming future a redesign of the page is in the works as of 2025. We are developing a Brand Identity reflecting on the transparancy element of the name Rechtsklarheit (legal certainty/transparency).
