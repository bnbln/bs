# Rebrand and digital transformation for a Berlin law firm

A contemporary law firm needs more than just a digital business card. In this project, I created a refined brand identity and a modern web presence tailored to the needs of a professional legal practice.

A comprehensive rebranding and digital transformation project for a  Berlin law firm, combining traditional legal gravitas with modern digital accessibility.

## Confidence meets Clarity

The visual language is simple and strong: A deep blue establishes trust and reliability, while subtle turquoise accents add a modern twist. The logo feels calm and confident, designed for flexible use across all media. The typography is clean and structured, ensuring excellent readability – especially on mobile.

## Built for Daily Use

The design system is modular, allowing dynamic layouts for service pages, legal content, or blog posts. The site is built with Next.js, hosted via Vercel for top performance, and content can be edited easily via a lightweight CMS.

The result: A consistent, flexible system that looks professional and can grow with the firm's needs – whether it’s expanding legal topics, adding blog posts or publishing updates.
