# Building strong brands at scale isn’t just about great visuals anymore. It’s about systems.

At the Premium Gruppe, I’m currently designing and building an automation platform that connects brand design, production and distribution into one coherent workflow.  
The goal is straightforward: make high-quality brand assets for streaming platforms faster, more reliable, and easier to scale — without losing craft or consistency.

This project lives exactly where my work tends to end up: between **brand design, automation and real-world production pressure**.


## The Challenge

We produce and maintain **hundreds of key visuals** across multiple streaming platforms:

- JOYN  
- Pluto TV  
- Amazon Prime Video  
- KDG / Vodafone  
- client platforms (welt.de, WELT mediathek and apps)

Each platform comes with its own reality:
- different aspect ratios  
- different technical specs  
- different deadlines  
- constantly shifting program schedules  

None of this is conceptually complex — but at scale, it becomes fragile.

Traditionally, a lot of time went into manual checks:  
availability, resizing, gap tracking, deadline coordination across teams.

The bottleneck wasn’t creative quality.  
It was **orchestration**.



## The System

I designed a workflow that connects data, logic and creative production into a single pipeline, using **n8n as the orchestration layer**.

The system is built to:

- **Detect missing assets** automatically per platform and format  
- **Generate structured tasks** with clear ownership and timing  
- **Scale, crop and validate existing key visuals** based on platform rules  
- **Trigger fast-turnaround production** for missing or breaking content  
- **Keep delivery states in sync** across internal tools and endpoints  

Instead of reacting late, the workflow now **anticipates gaps** before they surface downstream.

Editorial planning, brand design and delivery no longer operate as separate silos — they’re part of the same system.



## About the Tools

The tools matter, but only insofar as they stay out of the way.

For orchestration, I use **n8n** because it allows complex logic to remain readable, adaptable and debuggable — even as workflows grow.  
For generative visuals and explorations, I integrate APIs like **OpenAI / Gemini**, combined with internal design systems and validation steps.

The guiding principle is simple:  
automation should be **transparent**, not magical.

Especially when brand consistency is involved, teams need to understand *why* something happens — not just that it does.



## Design Meets Automation

This project isn’t about replacing designers.  
It’s about **protecting design quality under scale**.

By automating repetitive and error-prone steps, the system creates space for what still requires judgment:
concept, typography, composition and storytelling.

Brand systems don’t live in Figma alone.  
They live in **processes**, **decisions** and **tools** that support those decisions.

In that sense, this workflow treats brand design as a living system — not a static set of rules.



## What I Learned

- Brand consistency scales best when logic is explicit  
- Designers are well positioned to shape the systems they work with  
- Automation isn’t the opposite of creativity — it’s a multiplier  
- The best systems fade into the background while raising overall quality  

Most importantly:  
Strong brands aren’t defined only by how they look, but by **how smoothly they operate**.



## Why This Matters

I’m deeply interested in how brand design evolves in an automated, AI-assisted production landscape.

The most meaningful work, for me, happens one level above individual assets — where systems, tools and design intent meet.  
Building this workflow didn’t feel like “process work”.  
It felt like **brand design at a different level of abstraction**.

And that’s the direction I want to keep exploring.
