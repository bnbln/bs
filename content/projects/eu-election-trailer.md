For the 2024 EU election campaign, I created a trailer that frames Europe as a vibrant, forward-looking idea. The color palette is rooted in the EU flag: a deep blue with a turquoise twist and that unmistakable golden yellow.

```palette title="EU Color Palette" description="Primäre Trailer-Farben (Blau, Türkis, Gold + Kontraste)"

One standout detail: the twelve stars. They rotate in opposition to the overall scene while staying perfectly horizontal within the viewport. It's a subtle effect powered by After Effects expressions – but visually, it makes all the difference.

-thisComp.layer("EU FLAG ROTATION").transform.rotation
```

## The trailer also includes:

- the packshot
- an animated bar chart showing political stats
- visuals of EU buildings in Brussels  
- a ticker of European cities, countries and flags
- stylish split screens for pace and variety
- a cinematic color grade to tie it all together

The result? A motion-driven trailer full of structure, rhythm and European energy – and yes, it got nominated for the **2024 Eyes & Ears Award**.
