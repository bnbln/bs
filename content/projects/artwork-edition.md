# Film Production for Artist Editions
Designing a film that behaves like a moving exhibition — that was the task for the WELT Künstlerausgabe in 2024. Instead of leaning on narration, the piece lets space, light, and composition carry the message. The result is a focused, under-one-minute film that’s effortless to present at events or embed online.

The visual language places front pages of DIE WELT in minimalist, architectural interiors: illuminated cubes, suspended frames, and open gallery halls. Clean geometry and generous negative space give each edition the presence of a standalone artwork while keeping the environment quiet and unobtrusive.

The color palette stays restrained — cool blues, soft whites, and neutral grays in the rooms — so the editions themselves provide the bursts of color and texture.

```palette
Deep-Navy #003a5a rgb(0,58,90) usage=Brand Color
Gallery-White #F2F2F2 rgb(242,242,242) usage=Background
Neutral-Gray #A9A9A9 rgb(169,169,169) usage=Accents
```


Text elements are minimal and functional. Headlines and labels appear only where needed, aligning with the newspaper layout and keeping the moving image as the primary voice. The compact runtime and measured pacing make the piece adaptable — from exhibition screens to web and social.
