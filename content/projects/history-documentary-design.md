# Show Design for History Documentary Series

Designing for a history format that feels fast, fresh and not like a museum tour? Yes, please. When the production company asked me to take on the show’s visual identity, I knew this would be something fun to dig into.

The first idea came from the reference book and "Der Bader-Meinhof-Komplex", paired with those gritty 90s Spiegel TV graphics. Rough textures, Helvetica, punchy cuts – that raw, documentary feel was the core vibe I wanted to channel.

The color palette leans into black and white images and warm rust tones – like old film footage that’s been sitting on a shelf a little too long. There’s nostalgia, but also a sharp digital clarity that keeps it grounded in the now.

For the typeface, I chose **Berthold Block** – bold, boxy, full of character. It screams “headline” in the best way. And whether it’s in the opener, lower thirds, or on the site, it holds its ground.
