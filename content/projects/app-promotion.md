For this HbbTV spot, the goal was simple: make the red button feel like an invitation, not a technical feature.

I redesigned the app layout to feel clearer, bolder and more TV-native, then translated that design language into motion. Instead of cutting between static screens, the camera moves through the interface — diving into menus, gliding across navigation levels and pulling focus onto what really matters: the content.

Key visuals from WELT shows take center stage. Faces of the channel appear directly within the UI, anchoring the app emotionally and making it feel alive rather than abstract. The motion language is intentionally smooth and continuous, creating the impression that the app already exists inside the TV — you just need to enter it.

To tie the digital world back to the living room, the spot ends with a short 3D sequence built in Blender: a remote control in close-up, the red button clearly highlighted. One press, one action. The message is immediate and intuitive — press red to start.

The result is a compact, high-energy promo that connects broadcast, interface design and motion into one clear story: the WELT app is right there, just one button away.
