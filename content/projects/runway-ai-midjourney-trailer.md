The starting point for this project wasn’t a tool – it was a **camera idea**.

I wanted a shot that feels instantly cinematic:  
a smooth **camera move straight through an airport body scanner**, revealing the title **“Airport Security USA”**. A shot that would normally be expensive, hard to shoot and full of logistical hurdles. Similar stock footage was nit available  – perfect territory to explore what AI can actually contribute to professional trailer production.

### From idea to image

I began the process very traditionally: with a **rough sketch**. Just enough to define perspective, framing and the moment where the title should appear. This sketch then became the basis for my Midjourney prompts.

I generated **lots of variations** – tweaking scanner design, lighting, lens feel and crowd density. The goal wasn’t realism alone, but something that already felt like a frame from a TV production.

Once I had a promising base image, I moved into **Photoshop**. Here I cleaned up the composition, removing unnecessary people and visual noise to make the camera path clearer and the focus more intentional.

### Turning stills into motion

Next stop: **Runway AI**.

I defined a **dolly move straight through the scanner**, describing the camera motion, speed and depth in detail. It took a few attempts to get a usable result – some versions felt too floaty, others broke perspective – but eventually I landed on footage that felt grounded enough to work with.

With that clip in hand, I switched back to familiar territory: **After Effects**.

Even though the footage was AI-generated, I treated it like real camera material:
- tracking the camera move  
- stabilizing and refining the motion  
- placing the title cleanly into the scene  

On top of that, I added small details that sell the realism:
- a **subtle blinking light** on the scanner  
- restrained depth blur  
- cinematic color grading  
- a touch of grain to break the “too perfect” AI look  

All of it aimed at making the shot feel like something that could have been filmed on a real set.

### Why this matters

This project wasn’t about replacing traditional production – it was about **extending it**. AI helped me prototype a complex shot, iterate quickly and arrive at a result that would otherwise require a full location, extras and VFX work.

Used thoughtfully, these tools don’t lower quality – they **unlock ideas** that were previously out of reach.
