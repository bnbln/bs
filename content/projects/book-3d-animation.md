This project is a short 3D book sequence created as part of a promotional trailer for a space-themed book. The goal was not to over-stylize the object, but to give a familiar book a slightly cinematic, almost weightless quality that fits the tone of the subject matter.

The animation appears only briefly in the final trailer, but a lot of care went into making the movement feel calm, physical, and believable.

## Project Overview

The focus of this piece was the page-turning motion. Books are deceptively complex objects: pages bend, overlap, collide, and never move in a perfectly clean way. Capturing that behavior in a controlled but natural-looking animation was the main challenge.

The book was fully modeled and animated in **Blender**, with particular attention paid to scale, proportions, and how light interacts with paper and the cover material.

## Animation & Rigging

Each page was rigged using an **armature setup**, allowing controlled deformation while still being influenced by physics. Subtle simulations were layered on top to avoid overly rigid motion and to introduce small imperfections that make the movement feel more organic.

Rather than aiming for dramatic motion, the animation stays restrained and precise — letting the pages open smoothly and settle into place without drawing attention to the technique itself.

## Pipeline

- **Modeling & Animation**: Blender  
- **Rigging**: Armature-based page setup  
- **Physics**: Subtle simulations for natural movement  
- **Rendering**: Image sequence export  
- **Compositing & Color**: After Effects  

Rendering was done as an image sequence to keep full control in post-production. In **After Effects**, the shots were composited, gently color-corrected, and integrated into the overall look of the trailer.

## Technical Details

- **Frame Count**: 501 frames  
- **Frame Rate**: 24 fps  
- **Output**: Image sequence → final video  
- **Resolution**: High-definition  

## Reflection

Even though the sequence is short, it was a great opportunity to dive deeper into character-like rigging for non-character objects and to combine controlled animation with physical behavior. Projects like this are a reminder that small moments in a trailer often benefit the most from careful detail work.
