  It was early 2023 when AI was just about to take center stage in the tech
  world. My initial foray into Generative Images began a few months earlier with
  Midjourney. However, my real breakthrough came when I discovered Stable
  Diffusion.

The project was designed for the business department of the German news media brand WELT, aiming to attract young employees through an internal magazine by Axel Springer. The creative brief was to embody the claim "Erfolg beginnt mit neuem Denken" (Success begins with thinking new), integrating a QR-code.

## Discovering Stable Diffusion

Just as this project came to my desk, I started exploring Stable Diffusion and Midjourney.

I delved into its different models, plug-ins, inpainting features, and most notably, ControlNet. This tool revolutionized the way I could integrate images into the generation process, allowing for pixel-perfect inclusion of logos, typography, and even machine-readable QR-Codes.

## Inspiration from TikTok
Sometimes, inspiration comes from unexpected sources. For me, it was while scrolling through TikTok. I stumbled upon a video showcasing Stable Diffusion-generated artworks that seamlessly incorporated QR-codes into their designs. This experience opened my eyes to the full potential of AI in the creative process.

## The Creative Process

My workflow involved generating countless visuals, tweaking and experimenting with the outputs. Not all attempts were successful; some QR-codes were unreadable by my iPhone, while others lacked visual appeal or were distorted.

I focused on refining three core ideas using ControlNet and careful prompting:

- Up in the Sky - A theme that elevates the concept to new heights.
- Micro Chip - Reflecting the intricate, technology-driven aspect of our brand.
- Company Headquarters - Emphasizing our foundation and stability.

## Final Touches in Photoshop
The last step was to outpaint, upscale, and composite the image using Photoshop. This stage was crucial for placing the campaign claim and brand logo, correcting colors, and preparing a printable PDF that met the specifications of the print company.

## Reflections on AI in Creative Design

This project was a pivotal moment for me, demonstrating how AI can serve as a versatile tool in virtually any workflow. The thrill of integrating such cutting-edge technology into a printed magazine campaign continues to inspire my work.

Through this experience, I've seen firsthand the transformative impact AI can have on creative design, making the once-impossible a reality. It's an exciting time to be at the intersection of technology and creativity, and I look forward to pushing these boundaries even further.
